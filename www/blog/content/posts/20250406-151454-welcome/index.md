In 2017, I started a project called [Beeftext](https://beeftext.org), a open-source text substitution tool for Windows. It gained some popularity. According to [GitHub](https://github.com/xmichelo/Beeftext), Beeftext has been downloaded nearly 200'000 times. This number includes automatic updates, but it remains quite significant. As I never baked any form of telemetry or observability into the application, I do not have any other metric.

At the time, I was using [Alfred](https://alfred.app), and the snippet feature of the Alfred Power Pack was good enough for me on macOS. But my job was forcing me to spend a lot of time on Windows, where I could not find a free equivalent. I started Beeftext for my personal use, and decided to publish it under an open-source license. I maintained it for roughly 5 years, but in 2022, I was working nearly full time on macOS, and as Beeftext had all the features I wanted, I decided to put it on maintenance mode. 

Today, I barely use Windows. I work on several Mac computers, and Alfred does not support synchronization of snippets across several devices. Additionally, coming from a C++ background, I'm moving to Swift and SwiftUI, and the best way to learn a new language is to work on a project that solves a real world problem.

That why I have decided to start developing [Shoofler](https://shoofler.app), a text substitution tool for macOS. And I will be documenting the process in this blog.
