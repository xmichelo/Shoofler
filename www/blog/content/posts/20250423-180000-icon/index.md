title: 'Creating a great icon'
---

I happen to have a Master of Engineering in Computer Science with a specialization in computer graphics, but I'm definitely not an artist. So creating a good looking icon is not an easy task.

I went through several iterations, starting with an ugly cauliflower icon (Shoofler is pronounced as 'chou-fleur', the french word for cauliflower), and even when I was happy with the design, I changed to the color many times.

In the end, I picked a purple gradient.

I hate Figma with all my heart, so at home, I'm using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com), which has a very nice native macOS UI. I turn my subscription on and off depending on my needs, so over a year, I generally only pay 8 or 9 months.
