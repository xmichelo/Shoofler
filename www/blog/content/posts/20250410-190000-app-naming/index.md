title: 'Finding a name'
---

The first thing I needed to do was to pick a name for the application. And it's a difficult task. I decided not to keep the Beeftext name for this 
macOS application, because I do not want users to believe that Beeftext for Windows is still actively developed.

I set a few constraints:

1. The name should be short.
2. The name should be fun.
3. The name must be SEO friendly.

# And the winner is...

I finally decided to go with the name **Shoofler**.

- **Shoofler is short**: well, it a two syllable word. 
- **Shoofler is fun**: shoofler sounds fun in English, at least to me, and phonetically, it sounds like 'chou-fleur', the French word for cauliflower.
- **Shoofler is SEO friendly**: typing the word in a search engine leads to very little results, and the domain name `shoofler.app` was available.

# Alternatives

I considered two alternative names:

- **Texticle**: short and very funny. The domain `texticle.app` is available, but as you may imagine, typing the name in a search engine leads to mostly [NSFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work) content.
- **Calepin**: calepin is a French work that mean 'small notebook'. The name is short, fun, but `calepin.app` is not available, and only French speaking people will [pronounce it correctly](https://www.howtopronounce.com/french/calepin).
